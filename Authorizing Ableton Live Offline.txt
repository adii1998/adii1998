Instructions for Offline Authorization
--------------------------------------

To authorize Live offline you will need:

- A USB stick or external hard drive

- A different computer that has an internet connection

- Your Ableton serial number (if it hasnâ€™t been registered to your ableton.com account yet)

- Your hardware code: 2104-3E4C-9EB5-8FFA-A574-B544

Go to this page on a separate internet-connected computer to download an authorization file from your account: https://www.ableton.com/account/authorize/offline/ 

You can then move that file to your offline computer using a USB stick or external hard drive. Drag and drop the file anywhere into Live to complete the authorization.
